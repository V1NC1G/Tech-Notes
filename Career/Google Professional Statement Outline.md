# Google Professional Statement Outline

To develop a professional statement that briefly explains who you are and what you are passionate about, follow the steps outlined.

Note: You will need a piece of paper or a blank word processing document to complete this activity.

## Step one

List two to three strengths that you currently have or are committed to developing (e.g., strong with written and verbal communication, time management, programming, etc.).

Having an inventory of your strengths can help you create your professional statement. It may also encourage you to focus on skills you want to develop as you progress through the certificate program.

## Step two

List one to two values you have (e.g., protecting organizations, protecting people, adhering to laws, ensuring equitable access, etc.).

Establishing your values can help you and a prospective employer determine if your goals are aligned. Ensure that you are representing yourself accurately, and be honest about what motivates you.

## Step three

Ask yourself some clarifying questions to determine what to include in your professional statement:

1. What most interests me about the field of cybersecurity?
2. Who is the audience for my professional statement (e.g., cybersecurity recruiters, specific organizations, government employers, etc.)?
3. In what ways can my strengths, values, and interests in cybersecurity support the security goals of various organizations?

## Examples

Refer to the following professional statement examples for ideas: 

Example A: 
	I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented cybersecurity analyst. I actively work to identify and analyze potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, to help safeguard organizations and people alike.

Example B: 
	I am enthusiastic about information security and enjoy finding solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves. I place a high value on maintaining a strong security posture to help protect sensitive information and mitigate risk.
