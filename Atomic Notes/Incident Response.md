# Incident Response

Incident response is a methodology that is followed when an incident occurs such as a data breach or cyber attack, or less critical incidents such as misconfiguration, intrusion attempt, or policy violation.

The major phases of an incident response process (which can be found in an incident response [[Playbooks|playbook]]) are:

- Preparation
	- Refers to the team being ready to handle incidents.
- Detection and Analysis
	- The team should have the necessary resources to detect any incident.
- Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
	- Refers to stopping an incident from affecting other systems, elimination of the incident, and recovery of affected systems.
- Post-Incident Activity
	- Production of report
- Coordination
	- Reporting incidents and sharing information
