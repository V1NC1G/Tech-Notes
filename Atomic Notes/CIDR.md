# CIDR

**Classless Inter-Domain Routing**

It is a method of assigning subnet masks to [[IP Address|IP addresses]] to create a [[Subnetting|subnet]] and replaces [[Classful Addressing|classful addressing]].

Classless CIDR addressing expanded the number of available [[IPv4]] addresses.

CIDR allows security professionals to segment *classful* networks into smaller chunks.

CIDR IP addresses are formatted like [[IPv4]] addresses but **included a slash ("/") followed by a number at the end of the address** called the **IP network prefix**. 

> [!example] 
> **IPv4**: 192.51.100.0
> **CIDR IP Address**: 192.51.100.0/24

With the example above, the CIDR IP address encompasses all IP addresses between 198.51.100.0 and 198.51.100.255.
