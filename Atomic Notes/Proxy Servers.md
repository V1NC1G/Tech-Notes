# Proxy Servers

Servers that fulfills the requests of a client by forwarding them on to other servers.

They are dedicated servers that sits between the internet and the rest of the network.

When a request to connect to the network comes from the internet, the proxy server will determine if the connection is safe. 

The proxy server is a public [[IP Address|IP address]] that is different from the rest of the private network. This hides the private network's IP address from malicious actors on the internet and adds a layer of security.

It can also block unsafe websites that users aren't allowed to access on an organization's network.

A proxy server uses **temporary memory** that store data regularly requested by external servers. This **reduces contact with the internal server** thus enhancing security.
