# WPA3

**WPA3** is a more improved version of [[WPA2]] which:
- Addresses authentication handshake vulnerability to [[KRACK]] (Key Reinstallation Attack) attacks.
- Uses **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals** ([[SAE]]), a password authenticated, cipher-key-sharing agreement which prevents attackers from downloading data from wireless connections to their systems to attempt to decode it.
- Increased encryption to make passwords more secure by using 128 bit encryption, (WPA3 Enterprise Mode offering 192 bit encryption).
