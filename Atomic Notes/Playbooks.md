# Playbooks

Playbooks are manuals that provide details about any operational action, such as how to respond to a security incident.

Playbooks are generally used with [[SIEM]] tools by analysts where it can be used as reference or even an instruction manual on how to address the issue flagged by a SIEM tool.

Also used with [[Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response|SOAR]] tools where it can be used as a guide for analysts on how to resolve an issue.

In a case of a forensic case, there might be two playbooks a user might follow:

- **Chain of custody playbook**
	- It is the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle.
- **Protecting and preserving evidence playbook
	- Must consult the **order of volatility** which is a sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last.
	- Prioritize volatile data which is data that may be lost when the device in question powers off.
