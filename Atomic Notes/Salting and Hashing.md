# Salting and Hashing

**Hashing** converts an information into a unique value that can be used to determine its integrity, and is a one-way function meaning that it is impossible to decrypt and obtain the original text.

**Salting** adds random characters to hashed passwords which in turn increases the complexity of hash values making it more secure.
