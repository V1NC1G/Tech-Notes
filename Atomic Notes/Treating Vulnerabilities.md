# Treating Vulnerabilities

> [!summary] 
> The process of treating vulnerabilities to mitigate risk.

- **Remediation**: Threat removal by changing system configuration or patch application
- **Mitigate**: Reducing the likelihood of exploitation or reduce the risk or fallout from a flaw
- **Acceptance**: Identifying a weakness but keeping the issue unresolved due to either the fix being too large or the damage is not large enough to fix.
