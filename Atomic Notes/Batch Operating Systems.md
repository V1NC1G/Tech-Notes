User control gets passed to the next user when a task is complete. The advantage is that it allows many users to work on large projects at the same time.

The rationale between this approach is that large projects are broken into smaller chunks and do not require being loaded into memory all at once.

The challenge here is coordinating many different users at once as some tasks run slower due to excessive time spent waiting for the OS to free up resources.
