# Microsoft Dynamics

Microsoft Customer Relationship Management (CRM) combines popular standalone applications, such as Word and Excel, and more advanced applications such as Power BI, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents. A business wishing to manage its needs could use Dynamics CRM to organize its marketing, sales, and services. Data stored here can then be further analyzed to generate business insights. Some available services that could be selected include the following:

1. **Microsoft Dynamic 365 Marketing:** This easy-to-use business application provides a graphical interface for plotting the **customer journey**. A customer journey is a real-time marketing tool that monitors customer behaviors and enables push notifications, alerts, and updates to direct a customer to engage with a product. This service includes customizable emails and text messages that can be automated to execute after a specific trigger condition is met. The success of each approach can be recorded to generate analytics on how best to engage your customers. 
    
2. **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales:** An adaptive sales system that actively monitors sales signals. It uses AI and machine learning to generate sales initiatives from everyday workflows. This application allows you to import Excel worksheets that contain your sales data. From this, the application can perform sales analysis and identify trends. 
    
3. **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service:** This is a knowledge management center. It retains customer and agent experiences to provide company-wide knowledge-based for interactions with a company’s customers. 
    
4. **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service:** This service helps a company’s field agents by providing the required tools for mobile workers. The application provides tools for creating work orders, schedules, inventory, and billing. It enables a working document and updates all services provide from onsite. 
    
5. **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operation:** This is a project delivery tool that aims to connect sales, staffing, resources, project management, and finance teams. It assists project managers by providing work-breakdown structures, resource scheduling, and progress-tracking tools such as Gannt Charts.

These applications are designed to satisfy different customer needs. This means that before making a decision, a business must determine which aspects of its business require support. Perhaps it needs help determining where to focus its sales activities, documenting customer behavior to provide better services, monitoring interaction with a service in real-time, generating customized push notifications, or helping with accounting. The first step toward getting the most benefit from these services is self-analysis and identifying the business needs.
