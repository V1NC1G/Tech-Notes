# Network Testing

> [!summary] 
> Network testing is the process of identifying vulnerabilities by scanning a network and identifying open ports or services that can act as gateways for potential attacks that a malicious actor can access.

These vulnerabilities are listed and ranked according to the **threat level**. Using this, mitigating actions are determined.

> [!note] 
> Some ports are always open such as [[HTTPS]] which allows a user to connect and interact with the internet.
