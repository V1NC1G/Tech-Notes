The virus infected disk when inserted into a computer gets infected.

### Morris Worm

Created in 1988.

The intention of the virus is to assess the size of the internet by crawling the web and tallying all the computers connected to the internet.

What happened is that the program failed to track all the computers it had compromised and continued to re-install itself until the computers ran out of memory and crashed.

### LoveLetter Malware

Created to steal internet login credentials.

The attack is done by having users receive an email with the subject "I Love You" and has an attachment labeled "Love Letter For You".
