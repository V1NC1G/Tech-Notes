# Real-Time Operating Systems

> [!summary] 
> **RTOS** is a type of OS for applications that need real-time computations as it prioritizes tasks by importance.

Uses an **event-driven** approach, emphasizing on engaging and completing tasks as soon as they arise.

The priority of tasks is **determined by the time allocated**.

Commonly found in systems such as autonomous cars, air traffic controls, and more.

The advantage is that it can generate results quickly using a *priority queue* that emphasizes completing a task reactively.

The disadvantage is that it is very specialized and does not generalize well to performing a diverse range of tasks.
