# NIST RMF

**NIST Risk Management Framework**

Provides processes to integrate security into a system development lifecycle.

# Prepare

Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs.

Analysts uses this step to monitor for risks and identify controls that can be used to reduce those risks.

# Categorize

Used to develop [[Risk Management]] processes and tasks.

These processes can be used to develop tasks by thinking about how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and information can be impacted by risk.

# Select

Choose, customize, and capture documentation of [[Security Controls|security controls]] that protect an organization.

An example of the select step would be keeping a playbook up-to-date or helping to manage other documentation that allows you and your team to address issues more efficiently.

# Implement

Implement security and privacy plans for the organization.

# Assess

Determine if established controls are implemented correctly.

During this step, analysts identify potential weaknesses and determine whether the organization's tools, procedures, controls, and protocols should be changed to better manage potential risks.

# Authorize

Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization.

Authorization steps could involve generating reports, developing plans of action, and establishing project milestones that are aligned to your organization's security goals.

# Monitor

Be aware of how systems are operating.

Continuous monitoring of [[Security Controls|security controls]] and system risks.
