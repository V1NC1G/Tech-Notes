# Subnetting

**Subnetting** is the subdivision of a network into logical groups called subnets and basically works like *a network inside a network*.

It creates a network of devices to function as their own network which makes the network more efficient as it reduces the amount of unnecessary traffic that needs to be forwarded between different parts of the network.

## Security benefits of subnetting

Subnetting allows network professionals and analysts to create a network within their own network without requesting another network IP address from their ISP.

It is one component of creating **isolated** subnetworks through physical isolation, routing configuration, and firewalls.
