Typically, the network would contain **one server-based OS** that interacts with the OS of each individual device on the system.

It is also possible to have any number of devices on the network and can be of different types.

This approach is considered as **tightly-coupled** as the devices utilize a shared network and demonstrate high interactivity with each other.

**PROS**: 
Users can remotely log on to devices enabling easy upgrading as new devices can be added to the existing network.

**CONS**:
Costly to maintain and requires a centralized location for performing operations.
