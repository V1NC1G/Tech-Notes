# Data Lake

> [!summary] 
> It is a repository storing large amounts of data for later processing.

It allows actionable information to be extracted from data at a later stage.

Useful for:
- **IoT Sensor Analysis**: where there are noticeable data patterns that can be extracted from the devices and sensors on-premises.
- **Big Data Processing**: where machine learning or analytical algorithms can be applied to find actionable information in unsorted data.
- **Analytics**: for evaluating results of performing certain actions.
- **Reporting**: for gathering concrete insights about overall performance within a given period

## Benefits

- Data might be valuable in the future in ways that is unknown right now.
- In storing data wholesale, scientists can take different exploratory queries with the goal of discerning some valuable insights. These insights might be lost if data is processed before storing.
- Unstructured nature of a data lake means that data can be stored in various ways and it doesn't need to be processed and transformed beforehand.

## Challenges

- More difficult to query and locate specific data with the lack of schema.
- No way of ensuring the merit or worth of the data with the lack of data analysis.
- Security can be an additional challenge because not knowing the quality of data being stored makes it more challenging to regulate access.
- The lack of structure to the data means that some information can be lost or forgotten over time.

## [[Azure]] for data lakes
