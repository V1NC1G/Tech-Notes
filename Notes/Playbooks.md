# Playbooks

Playbooks are manuals that provide details about any operational action, such as how to respond to a security incident.

In a case of a forensic case, there might be two playbooks a user might follow:

- **Chain of custody playbook**
	- It is the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle.
- **Protecting and preserving evidence playbook
	- Must consult the **order of volatility** which is a sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last.
	- Prioritize volatile data which is data that may be lost when the device in question powers off.
