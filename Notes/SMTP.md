**Simple Mail Transfer Protocol**

Used to transmit and route email from the sender to the recipient's address.

Works with Message Transfer Agent ([[MTA]]) software which searches [[DNS]] servers to resolve email addresses to [[IP Address]] to ensure it reaches their intended destination.

Uses [[TCP]]/[[UDP]] port 25 for unencrypted emails and is used by high-volume spam.

[[TCP]]/[[UDP]] port 587 using [[TLS]] for encrypted emails.
