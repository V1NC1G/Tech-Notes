# Internal Threats

An **internal threat** comes from current or former employees, external vendors, or trusted partners.

Internal threats are often accidental such as an employee clicking on a compromised link in an email.

Other times, the *internal actor* intentionally engages in activities such as unauthorized data access or abusing systems for personal use.
