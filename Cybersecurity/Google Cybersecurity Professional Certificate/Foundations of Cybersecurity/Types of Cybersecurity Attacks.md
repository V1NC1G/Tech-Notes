## Attack Types

### Password Attack

An attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data.

Some forms of password attacks:
- Brute force
- Rainbow table

Password attacks fall under the [[The Eight CISSP Domains#Communication and Network Security|communication and network security]] domain.

### Social Engineering Attack

Manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

Social engineering attacks are related to the [[The Eight CISSP Domains#Security and Risk Management|security and risk management]] domain.

### Physical Attack

A security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed.

- Malicious USB cable
- Malicious flash drive
- Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the [[The Eight CISSP Domains#Asset Security|asset security]] domain.

### Adversarial Artificial Intelligence

It is a technique that manipulates AI and ML technology to conduct attacks more efficiently.

Adversarial artificial intelligence fall under both the [[The Eight CISSP Domains#Communication and Network Security|communication and network security]] and [[The Eight CISSP Domains#Identity and Access Management|identity and access management]] domains.

### Supply-chain Attack

Targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed.

Attacks can occur at any point in the supply chain as third parties are often involved.

These attacks are costly as multiple organizations and individuals can be affected.

Supply-chain attacks fall under several domains including but not limited to:
- [[The Eight CISSP Domains#Security and Risk Management|Security and Risk Management]]
- [[The Eight CISSP Domains#Security Architecture and Engineering|Security Architecture and Engineering]]
- [[The Eight CISSP Domains#Security Operations|Security Operations]]

### Cryptographic Attack

Affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient.

Forms of cryptographic attacks:
- Birthday
- Collision
- Downgrade

Cryptographic attacks fall under the [[The Eight CISSP Domains#Communication and Network Security|communication and network security]] domain.
