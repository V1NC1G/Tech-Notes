# The Eight CISSP Domains

Topics: #cybersecurity #cissp #domain

## Security and Risk Management

Defines 
- Security goals and objectives
	- Organizations can reduce risks to critical assets and data
- Risk mitigation
	- The process of having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach
- Compliance
	- Primary method used to develop an organization's internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards
- Business continuity
	- An organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans
- Legal regulations
- Professional and organizational ethics

Information security, or InfoSec, is also related to this domain and refers to a set of processes (can also be called as a playbook) established to secure information.

## Asset Security

Secures digital and physical assets. It is also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

This means that assets such as PII or SPII should be securely handled and protected.

## Security Architecture and Engineering

Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.

One of the core concept of secure design architecture is [[Shared Responsibility|shared responsibility]].

Additional security system design principles related to this domain:
- Threat modeling
- Least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Fail securely
- Separation of duties
- Keep it simple
- Zero trust
- Trust but verify

## Communication and Network Security

Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications that includes on-site, remote, and cloud communications.

## Identity and Access Management

Focuses on access and authorization.

Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications.

Components of IAM:
- Identification
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Accountability

## Security Assessment and Testing

Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats and vulnerabilities.

Security assessments help organizations determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risk.

It emphasizes the need for security audits to monitor for and reduce the possibility of a data breach.

## Security Operations

Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

Covers digital forensics to identify when, how, and why a breach occur. This is to also determine areas for improvement and preventative measures that can be taken to mitigate future attacks.

Investigation and preventative measure strategies, processes, and tools include:
- Training and awareness
- Reporting and documentation
- Intrusion detection and prevention
- SIEM tools
- Log management
- Incident management
- Playbooks
- Post-breach forensics
- Reflecting on lessons learned

## Software Development Security

Uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.

Makes use of the software development lifecycle and add security as an additional step to the lifecycle as to ensure that each phase of the lifecycle undergoes security reviews so that security can be fully integrated into the software product.
