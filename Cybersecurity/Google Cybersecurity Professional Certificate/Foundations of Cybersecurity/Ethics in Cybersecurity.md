## Ethical concerns and laws related to counterattacks

In the U.S., deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of the laws like the *Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986* and the *Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015* among others.

Counterattacks can lead to further escalation of the attack which can cause even more damage and harm.

If a threat actor is a state-sponsored *hacktivist*, a counterattack can lead to serious international implications.

Only individuals that are approved employees of the federal government or military personnel are allowed to counterattack.

## International Standpoint on Counterattacks

The **International Court of Justice** (ICJ) states that a person a group can counterattack if:

- The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first
- The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop
- The counterattack does not escalate the situation
- The counterattack effects can be reversed
