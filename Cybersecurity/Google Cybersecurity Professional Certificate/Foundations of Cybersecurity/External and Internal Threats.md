# External and Internal Threats

Topics: #cybersecurity 

## External Threats

An **external threat** is someone outside the organization trying to gain access to private information, networks, or devices.

## Internal Threats

An **internal threat** comes from current or former employees, external vendors, or trusted partners.

Internal threats are often accidental such as an employee clicking on a compromised link in an email.

Other times, the *internal actor* intentionally engages in activities such as unauthorized data access or abusing systems for personal use.
