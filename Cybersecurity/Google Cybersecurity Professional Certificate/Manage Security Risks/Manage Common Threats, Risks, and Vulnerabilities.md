## Risk Management

The primary goal of organizations is to protect assets.

Some common strategies used to manage risks include:
- **Acceptance**
	- Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity
- **Avoidance**
	- Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
- **Transference**
	- Transferring risk to a third party to manage
- **Mitigation**
	- Lessening the impact of a known risk

Additionally, organizations implement risk management processes based on widely accepted frameworks such as [[NIST RMF]] and [[HITRUST]]
