# Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

Topics: #cybersecurity #threat #risk #vulnerability

## Threat

Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

A [[Social Engineering|social engineering]] attack is a type of threat.

Some other common threats are:
- **Insider threats**
	- Abusing authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization
- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**
	- A threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.

## Risk

Risks are anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.

Organizations tend to rate risks at different levels:

- **Low-risk asset**
	- Information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.
- **Medium-risk asset**
	- Information that is not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.
- **High-risk asset**
	- Information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised could have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation.

Some factors that affect the likelihood of a risk to an organization's assets are:
- **External Risk**
	- Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information
- **Internal Risk**
	- A current/former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk.
- **Legacy Systems**
	- Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can impact assets.
- **Multiparty Risk**
	- Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.
- **Software Compliance/Licensing**
	- Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner.

## Vulnerability

A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

Examples:
- Outdated firewall
- Software/Application
- Weak passwords
- Unprotected confidential data
- People
	- People's actions can significantly affect an organization's internal network

Some other vulnerabilities include:
- **ProxyLogon**
	- A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server.
	- This means that a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.
- **ZeroLogon**
	- A vulnerability in Microsoft's Netlogon authentication protocol that is a service that ensures a user's identity before allowing access to a website's location.
- **Log4Shell**
	- Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else's computer or leak sensitive information by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.
- **PetitPotam**
	- Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM).
	- It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.
- **Security logging and monitoring failures**
	- Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it.
- **Server side request forgery**
	- Allows an attacker to manipulate server-side applications into accessing and updating backend resources.
	- It can also allow threat actors to steal data.
