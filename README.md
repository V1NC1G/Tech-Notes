# Obsidian Notes


This is a public repo on all my notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## About my notes

My notes are heavily focused on **Cyber Security** and certification notes but will contain different topics here and there.

My process of taking notes is by writing a concept in an "atomic" format which just basically means that *almost* every note inside the [Atomic Notes](./Atomic\ Notes) directory are standalone concepts and topics and does not need any other reference note to understand.

For example, my note on [Asset Security](./Atomic\ Notes/Asset/ Security.md) is basically just explaining what asset security is.

Another thing to take note is that almost all of my notes contain a "Flashcards" section as I do spaced repetition to drill all the concepts in my head. If you wish to use my flashcards within Obsidian and remove all the spaced repetition timings for your use case, I haven't seen a feature for this yet but you can either create a custom script or manually remove the timestamp which is at the bottom of each flashcard note.

## Viewing this repo:

Using the Obsidian desktop app is the best way to view all my notes at it contains links and connections between topics and images/diagrams. This type of formatting won't work with markdown alone.

### Steps:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open Obsidian and select this repo as a vault.

## P.S. Contributing

If you find any mistakes, flaws, or misinformation on my notes and topics that needs correcting, please feel free to create a branch with your changes and raise a pull request.

I aim to have all my notes accurate not only for me, but for everyone who wishes to use my notes as well for studying. 

Happy learning!
