## Adopt a Zero Trust security strategy

A [[Zero Trust Framework]] starts with the principle that you can no longer trust an access request even if it comes from inside the network. This is because more organizations now are adopting hybrid work models and gives employees the ability to work in the office and remotely.

It mitigates risk by by assuming that you have been breached and explicitly verify all request access.

This practice also employs [[Principle of least privilege|least privilege access]] to give access only to needed resources and nothing more.

## Conduct regular cybersecurity training

Confronting cybercriminals requires that everyone works together to make the online world safer.

Teaching a team on how to safeguard their personal devices and help them to recognize and stop [[Cyberattack|cyberattacks]] with regular training can reduce the risk of employees/individuals falling pray to [[Social Engineering|social engineering]] attacks like [[Phishing|phishing]], or any other type of cyberattack.

## Institute cybersecurity processes

To reduce risk of [[Cyberattack|cyberattacks]], develop processes that help you **prevent, detect, and respond** to an attack. 

Some processes to follow are:
- Performing regular hardware and software [[Patches|patches]]
- Provide clear guidelines to the team

Processes doesn't need to be created from scratch since there are [[Cybersecurity Frameworks|frameworks]] available to follow such as [[ISO-IEC 27001]] or [[NIST CSF]].

## Invest in comprehensive solutions

Technology solutions that help address security issues improve every year. Get a holistic view into your environment and eliminate gaps in coverage with **comprehensive cybersecurity solutions** that work together with your ecosystem to safeguard identities, endpoints, apps, and clouds.
